# City Weather App

City Weather App allows you to instantly access the current weather conditions of any city in the world.

## How It Works

Get the latest weather data by typing the name of the city you're curious about in the search bar. The app will send a request to OpenWeatherMap.org and fetch the data.

After the data is accessed, you are presented with a summary of the city's weather, including:

- Current weather conditions
- Temperature
- Feels-like temperature
- Minimum temperature of the day
- Maximum temperature of the day
- Humidity level
